# Team Profile Generator
      
## Description

In this assignment we were tasked with creating an application that could generate a team profile from command line. The application should take in user input and generate an HTML file when the application is run. The HTML file should a team roster of employees based on input from the user. This is done through the use of the inquirer module allowing users to input information into the program. Then using template literals and case functions the cards are built and displayed on the page. The email addresses in the card needed to be able to open the default email program and start a message to that email. The GitHub username also needed to be able to be opened in a new tab. When the application starts the user is asked if they would like to add a team member and what team member type they would like to add. They are then prompeted for that team member's name, ID, email. The engineer is also prompted for their GitHub. The manager is also prompted for their office number, and the intern is also prompted for their school. After selections are made they are allowed to choose again or generate the team. When they choose to generate the team then the HTML file is generated and the application is closed.
